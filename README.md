# Insurance Prediction using ANN

## Overview
Artificial Neural Networks Models were created using various methods to predict whether a customer would take an insurance or not.

## Methods Used
* ANN was build from scratch using classes and functions.
* ANN was build using Keras of Tensorflow.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3 
* an IDE (preferably Jupyter Notebook)
* Pandas 
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib 
* Sklearn 
* Tensorflow
* Keras

All the external dependencies can be installed by using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
